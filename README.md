# Overview

The dataset I analysed measured the sleep patterns and the cognitive ability of 60 people.

This project was used to introduce myself to data analysis using programming tools.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Is sleep time directly correlated with performance? 
There is a weak correlation between the sleep time and cognitive performance.

Is there a noticable difference between higher and lower half of the sleep data?
No, the cognitive performance between the group with the 30 highest sleep times 
were almost identical to the cognitive performance to the group with the 30 lowest sleep times.

Overall, the length of sleep does not appear to be the main contributer to cognitive performance.

# Development Environment

The program uses many functions to generate the correlation coefficent. A number of data frame manipulation is used too.

The language used is Python, and Pandas is the primary library.

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html)

# Future Work

* Implement the .corr function to simplify the code.
* Create functions testing more productive questions.
